there are three scope in javascript
Global -
Block -
Functional/Local -


var ->functional scope 
let -> block scope
const -> block scope


var a= 8;
{
    //block scope 
}

int function(){
    //the function boady is itself functional scope
}





coercion
exception is only for + (-:-)
strig+num = string
num+strig = string

string * string = num

equality- 
== is the operator->only value
=== -> value and its type
